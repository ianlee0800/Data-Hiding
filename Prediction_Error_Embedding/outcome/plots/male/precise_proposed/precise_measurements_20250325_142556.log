================================================================================

Step 1: Finding maximum payload capacity
Maximum payload: 2530990 bits
Max BPP: 2.413740
Time taken: 95.20 seconds

Step 2: Calculating 20 evenly distributed payload points
Target payload points:
  Point 1: 126549 bits (5.0% of max)
  Point 2: 253099 bits (10.0% of max)
  Point 3: 379648 bits (15.0% of max)
  Point 4: 506198 bits (20.0% of max)
  Point 5: 632747 bits (25.0% of max)
  Point 6: 759297 bits (30.0% of max)
  Point 7: 885846 bits (35.0% of max)
  Point 8: 1012396 bits (40.0% of max)
  Point 9: 1138945 bits (45.0% of max)
  Point 10: 1265495 bits (50.0% of max)
  Point 11: 1392044 bits (55.0% of max)
  Point 12: 1518594 bits (60.0% of max)
  Point 13: 1645143 bits (65.0% of max)
  Point 14: 1771693 bits (70.0% of max)
  Point 15: 1898242 bits (75.0% of max)
  Point 16: 2024792 bits (80.0% of max)
  Point 17: 2151341 bits (85.0% of max)
  Point 18: 2277891 bits (90.0% of max)
  Point 19: 2404440 bits (95.0% of max)
  Point 20: 2530990 bits (100.0% of max)

Step 3: Running embedding algorithm for each target point
100.0% target (Max capacity):
  Target: 2530990 bits
  Actual: 2530990 bits
  BPP: 2.413740
  PSNR: 44.03
  SSIM: 0.9845
  Hist_Corr: 0.9248
  Time: 95.20 seconds

5.0% target:
  Target: 126549 bits
