================================================================================

Step 1: Finding maximum payload capacity
Maximum payload: 904595 bits
Max BPP: 0.862689
Time taken: 1.56 seconds

Step 2: Calculating measurement points with 100000 bit steps
Target payload points:
  Point 1: 100000 bits (11.1% of max)
  Point 2: 200000 bits (22.1% of max)
  Point 3: 300000 bits (33.2% of max)
  Point 4: 400000 bits (44.2% of max)
  Point 5: 500000 bits (55.3% of max)
  Point 6: 600000 bits (66.3% of max)
  Point 7: 700000 bits (77.4% of max)
  Point 8: 800000 bits (88.4% of max)
  Point 9: 900000 bits (99.5% of max)
  Point 10: 904595 bits (100.0% of max)

Step 3: Running embedding algorithm for each target point
100.0% target (Max capacity):
  Target: 904595 bits
  Actual: 904595 bits
  BPP: 0.862689
  PSNR: 51.70
  SSIM: 0.9964
  Hist_Corr: 0.9898
  Time: 1.56 seconds

11.1% target:
  Target: 100000 bits
